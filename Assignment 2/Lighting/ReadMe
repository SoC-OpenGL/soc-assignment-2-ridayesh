This is the third question.
You can control the camera as follows:
    1. WASD = Movement
    2. Mouse = Look Around
    3. C = To move up
    4. V = To move down
    5. Z = To zoom in
    6. X = To zoom out

To change between Sources of light:
    1. P = Point Source
    2. F = Flashlight
    // DEFAULT = Point Source
To change between Shading Models:
    1. B = Blinn-Phong Model
    2. N = Phong-Model

PLEASE NOTE: CHANGE THE PATHS OF THE TEXTURES, SHADERS WHEREVER NEEDED.
